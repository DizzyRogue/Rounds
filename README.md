Rounds
======

Python 2 based dart game intended to help increase Cricket scores.

BASIC RULES:
1) Player attempts to get 3 "hits" on each target.
2) Targets are Bullseyes, 20's, 19's, 18's, 17's, 16's, and 15's. 
3) Triples count as 3 hits, doubles 2, and singles 1. Bullseyes are doubles and singles.
4) Hits only count on active target.
5) 3 throws per round.
6) Max 5 rounds per target.
7) Remaining darts in hand once 3 hits on current target are called "hangers".
8) Hangers are thrown at the next target for extra points. 
9) Points are awarded in two ways, quality of hits and number of rounds to close target. 

Multi-Points:
Singles = 10 points
Doubles = 50 points 
Triples = 100 points

Round Bonus Points:
0 Round (close out target with hangers) = 350 points
1 Round = 100 points
2 Rounds = 50 points
3 Rounds = 25 points
4 Rounds = 15 points
5 Rounds = 5 points

Total Round Score = Multi Points + Round Bonus Points
Total Score = Sum of total round scores
